# .NET Aspire Manifest generator
A dumb little utility to quickly generate a deployment manifest from VS solution explorer.

I honestly don't expect anyone to use this beyond myself and a few other team members for quick validation purposes in Visual Studio, demo purposes, etc. so with that it comes with the "works on my machine" level of quality guarantee.

## Installation
Install from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TimHeuer.AspireManifestGen) or from the Extension Manager directly in Visual Studio.
